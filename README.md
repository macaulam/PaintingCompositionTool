# PaintingCompositionTool
This is really just for fun... but I wondered if I could make a tool to develop new compositions for paintings that I have been creating.

I found an interesting random generator created by Roni Kaufman (https://github.com/ronikaufman) and have been editing the code to suit my purposes. I aim to carry on editing the programme.
