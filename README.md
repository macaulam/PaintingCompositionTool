## This repository contains an application that generates random compositional structures and color combinations for paintings. The app aims to provide users with new ideas for the strucutres of my paintings, breaking me out of habitual patterns and encouraging experimentation with different color schemes and compositions.

## The application uses probability to change the color combinations and compositional structures it generates. It uses probability to decide which colors will be used in a given composition, or to decide on the placement of elements within the painting. By using probability, the application is able to create a wide range of different combinations, and ensure that each one is visually pleasing and well-balanced. Additionally, the application uses probability to give a chance for certain color combinations or composition structures to be generated more frequently than others, depending on the user preferences.

## Here are a few early examples:

Thanks to Roni Kaufman (https://github.com/ronikaufman) for the starter code, and Marc Vaux for letting me into his studio to see how he uses software to choose colours for his artworks.
